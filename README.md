- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pedro961247
- Or if you want you can call me Zebedelu.
- i'm from Brazil.

I like the programming area, as it is the new technology of the moment,
I started studying about it in 2021, but I am starting to create my GitHub in 2024

I even know a lot of programming languages.
like:
- Intermediate: Python, Lua.
- Basic: C#, C++, javascript.

- Certificates:
-   Codechef: C#.

- I'm creating my github just so I can freelance and post my progress as a programmer.
Use my codes however you want, it's just learning :).
